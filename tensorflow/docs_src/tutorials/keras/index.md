# Learn and use machine learning

This notebook collection is inspired by the book
*[Deep Learning with Python](https://books.google.com/books?id=Yo3CAQAACAAJ)*.
These tutorials use `tf.keras`, TensorFlow's high-level Python API for building
and training deep learning models. To learn more about using Keras with
TensorFlow, see the [TensorFlow Keras Guide](../../guide/keras).

Publisher's note: *Deep Learning with Python* introduces the field of deep
learning using the Python language and the powerful Keras library. Written by
Keras creator and Google AI researcher Fran√ßois Chollet, this book builds your
understanding through intuitive explanations and practical examples.

To learn about machine learning fundamentals and concepts, consider taking the
[Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).
Additional TensorFlow and machine learning resources are listed in [next steps](../next_steps).
